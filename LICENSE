Each sub-project in nmdb source tree has an independant license, and can be
treated as independant projects from a licensing point of view.

Licenses are always in a file named "LICENSE" in the top directory of each
sub-project, and apply to ALL the source code files in that directory tree
(that is, including subdirectories).

As a brief resume, here's how each sub-project is licensed:

 * nmdb: BOLA (Public domain)
 * libnmdb: BOLA (Public domain)
 * bindings/bigloo: BOLA (Public domain)
 * bindings/d: BOLA (Public domain)
 * bindings/haskell: BOLA (Public domain)
 * bindings/newlisp: BOLA (Public domain)
 * bindings/python: BOLA (Public domain)
 * bindings/ruby: BOLA (Public domain)
