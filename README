nmdb - A TIPC-based database manager
Alberto Bertogli (albertito@gmail.com)
-----------------------------------------

nmdb is a network database that uses the TIPC protocol to communicate with
it's clients.

It consists of an in-memory cache, that saves (key, value) pairs, and a
persistant backend that stores the pairs on disk.

Both work combined, but the use of the persistant backend is optional, so you
can use the server only for cache queries, pretty much like memcached.

This source distribution is composed of several parts: the server called
"nmdb", the library and the python bindings. Each one has a separate top level
directory, and is licensed individually. See the LICENSE file for more
information.

For additional documentation and resources, go to the project's website at
http://auriga.wearlab.de/~alb/nmdb.


How to compile, test and install
--------------------------------

You will need to be running a kernel >= 2.6.16, and to have kernel headers
also >= 2.6.16. Alternatively, you can run a TIPC patched kernel, and have the
tipc.h header be put somewhere in the include path by hand.

To compile the server and the library, you can just use "make" on their
directories. To install them, use "make install".

To test the application, start the server and then go to the library
directory. Run "make tests", and then use the "test1c" and "test2c" to test
the cache layer, and "test1d" and "test2d" to test the database backend.

To compile the Python bindings, you need to have the library already
installed. Go to the directory and run "python setup.py install", which will
build and install the modules. The module will be named "nmdb".
