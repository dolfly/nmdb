nmdb - A multiprotocol network database manager
Alberto Bertogli (albertito@blitiri.com.ar)
---------------------------------------------------

nmdb is a network database that can use different protocols to communicate
with its clients. At the moment, it supports TIPC, TCP, UDP and SCTP.

It consists of an in-memory cache, that saves (key, value) pairs, and a
persistent backend that stores the pairs on disk.

Both work combined, but the use of the persistent backend is optional, so you
can use the server only for cache queries, pretty much like memcached.

This source distribution is composed of several parts: the server called
"nmdb", the library and bindings for Python (2 and 3), D, NewLISP, Ruby,
Bigloo Scheme and Haskell. Each one has a separate directory, and is licensed
individually. See the LICENSE file for more information.


Documentation
-------------

Most documentation is in the nmdb and libnmdb manpages, and inside the doc/
directory. It is recommended that you read the User Guide (doc/guide.rst, or
the online version) to learn how to setup and use nmdb.

For additional documentation and resources, go to the project's website at
