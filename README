nmdb - A TIPC-based database manager
Alberto Bertogli (albertito@gmail.com)
-----------------------------------------

nmdb is a network database that uses the TIPC protocol to communicate with
it's clients.

It consists of an in-memory cache, that saves (key, value) pairs, and a
persistent backend that stores the pairs on disk.

Both work combined, but the use of the persistent backend is optional, so you
can use the server only for cache queries, pretty much like memcached.

This source distribution is composed of several parts: the server called
"nmdb", the library and bindings for Python, D and NewLISP. Each one has a
separate directory, and is licensed individually. See the LICENSE file for
more information.


Documentation
-------------

Most documentation is in the nmdb and libnmdb manpages, and inside the doc/
directory. It is recommended that you read the User Guide (doc/guide.rst, or
the online version) to learn how to setup and use nmdb.

For additional documentation and resources, go to the project's website at
http://auriga.wearlab.de/~alb/nmdb.


How to compile, test and install
--------------------------------

Requisites:
 * Running Linux kernel >= 2.6.16 with TIPC enabled.
 * Kernel headers also >= 2.6.16. Alternatively, you can run a TIPC patched
     kernel, and have the tipc.h header be put somewhere in the include path
     by hand.
 * libevent (http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/).
 * qdbm (http://qdbm.sf.net/).

To compile the server and the library, you can just use "make" on their
directories. To install them, use "make install".

To run some tests, start the server and then go to the library directory. Run
"make tests", and then use the "test1c" and "test2c" to test the cache layer,
and "test1d" and "test2d" to test the database backend.

To compile the Python bindings, you need to have the library already
installed. Go to the directory and run "python setup.py install", which will
build and install the modules. The module will be named "nmdb".
