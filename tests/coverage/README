Here you will find two scripts that can be used to generate code coverage
reports.


"coverage" runs the server and all the other tests with different parameters,
trying to maximize code coverage.

As it does not test for correctness, it is mostly useful to see which code is
not used by the other tests. The output is saved to /tmp/nmdb-lcov.log, to
allow manual verification of the test results.

It can be combined with gcov, lcov, or other code coverage tools, to generate
friendly reports.


"lcov-start" and "lcov-stop" can be used to generate coverage reports with the
lcov tool (http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php). The reports are
generated in the "lcov/" subdirectory.
